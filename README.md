# Overview
Working on developing a VR Game based around VR swinging mechanics. Hoping to turn the game into something similar to Shadow of the Colossus, fighting giant bosses focusing primarily on movement mechanics. Recently picked up progress on the game once again, hoping to finish up a lot of the goals soon. Currently working on combat functionality, and will be transitioning into working on bosses soon.

For the most up to date build of the game, https://sathvikcookie.itch.io/vr-grappling-hook-game
